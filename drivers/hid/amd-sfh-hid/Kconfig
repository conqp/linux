	If you say yes to this option, support will be included for the AMD
	Sensor Fusion Hub.
	This driver will enable sensors functionality to user through HID
	framework. Basically this driver will get data from MP2 Firmware
	and provide that data to HID framework.
	MP2 which is an ARMÂ® Cortex-M4 core based co-processor to x86.

	This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module will
	be  called amd-sfhtp-hid.
